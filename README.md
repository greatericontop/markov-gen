Markov Chain Text Generator

# About
Markov Chains allow the prediction of a future state based on the characteristics of a present state. Suitable for text, the principle of Markov chain can be turned into a sentences generator. 

The project contains two types of Markov Models:
- **N-gram**<br>
An n-gram is simply a sequence of units drawn from a longer sequence.
- **Word Markov Model**<br>
Uses each word as a sequence of units drawn from the text corpus.

_Note_ - The generator is in its early stages so it generates improper sentences without caring for the sentence structure. Modifications will be made in the next update.
